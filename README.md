## Building and Running

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
./run.sh
```

This script will:
- Stop any running instance
- Clean previous builds
- Build a fresh app bundle with proper entitlements
- Launch the app automatically

### Manual Build
```bash
./build-app.sh
open Murmur.app
```

### Xcode
1. Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory
2. Generate Xcode project:

   ```
3. Open `Murmur.xcodeproj` in Xcode
4. Select "Murmur" scheme
5. Click Run (Cmd+R)

**Note:** `swift run` won't work directly due to privacy/entitlement requirements. Use the run script, build script, or Xcode.

## First Run

On first launch, macOS will ask for permissions:
1. **Microphone Access** - Required to capture your voice
2. **Speech Recognition** - Required to transcribe speech
3. **Accessibility** - Required to type into other applications (prompted when auto-type is enabled)

Grant all permissions for the app to work properly. After granting Accessibility permissions, you may need to restart the app.

## Usage

### Quick Dictation (Recommended)

1. Focus any text field in any application (email, document, browser, etc.)
2. **Hold down the right Command (‚åò) key** to start recording
3. Speak naturally in your selected language
4. **Release the right Command (‚åò) key** to stop recording
5. The transcribed text will automatically appear in your focused text field!

### Manual Control

1. Click the menu bar icon (waveform symbol) to open the control panel
2. **Select your language** (English or Spanish) from the dropdown
3. **Toggle "Auto-type to active app"** to enable/disable automatic typing
4. Click "Start" to begin recording (or use the hotkey)
5. Speak naturally in your selected language
6. The transcription appears in real-time and can be edited
7. Click "Stop" to end recording
8. With auto-type enabled: text is automatically typed into the previously active application
9. With auto-type disabled: click "Copy" to copy text to clipboard, then paste anywhere

### Advanced Features
